- 👋 Hi, I’m @ntomar55 Nikita Tomar
- 👀 I’m interested in Bioinformatics and data science to curate and visualize biological data extracted from biological processes 
   like Next Generation Sequencing (Illumina), Microarray analysis, protein - protein interaction etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding in Python, R and SQL. I am a second semester graduate student in Bioinformatics at Boston University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any biological data related projects.
- 📫 I can be reached at ntomar@bu.edu.
